					Java
				</header>
				<p> <b>Description</b> 
					<br>
					Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, 
					and network-centric language that can be used 
					as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure,
					reliable programming language for coding everything 
					from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data 
					applications and server-side technologies
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Companies that uses java</b>
					<br>
					Big companies uses Java as there main program. Some of
					these big companies include, <i>Microsoft</i>, <i>Google</i>, <i>Amazon</i>
					, <i>Accenture</i>, <i>Uber</i>, <i>Spotify</i>, <i>Netflix</i>, <i>Instagram</i>, 
					<i>Ebay</i>, <i>Airbnb</i>, and <i>Zillow</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>My Experience</b>
					<br>
					My experice with Java so far is that I know the basics. Meaning I know how to do math in
					Java, convert an input number of the user in Celcius or vise versa Fahrenheit, Print out 
					the user inputs and much more.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Let us now look at a basic program of Java: </b>
					<br>
				</p>
				<code>
					class HelloWorld
					<br>
					{
					 <br>
					 &nbsp &nbsppublic static void main (String[]args)
					 <br>
					 &nbsp &nbsp{
				     <br>
					 &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSystem.ou.println("Hello World");
					 <br>&nbsp &nbsp}
					 <br>

					} 
					 
				</code>
				<br>
				<p> <b>The output of the code above is:</b> Hello World
					<br> 
					<br>
					This one of the most basic java code anyone can learn and how with this you
					can start making other codes as well like I am doing.

					HTML
				</header>
				<p> <b>Description</b> 
					<br>
					HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its 
					content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of 
					bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will 
					give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions. 
					<br>
					<br>
					HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a 
					series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make 
					it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image 
					hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

					CSS
				</header>
				<p> <b>Description</b> 
					<br>
					CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, 
					laid out, etc. 
					<br>
					<br>
					A <b>document</b> is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the 
					most common markup language.
					<br>
					<br>
                    <b>Presenting</b> a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. 
					Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, 
					for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
					<br>
					<br>
                    CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and 
					size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single 
					column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. 
					It can even be used for effects such as animation.
					<br>

					these big companies include, <i>Squarespace</i>, <i>RS21</i>, <i>BlueConic</i>, <i>Unlearn.AI</i>,

				</p>

					<b>My Experience</b>
					<br>
					My experice with CSS so far is that I know the basics. Meaning I know how to make element colorful
					or stand our in my webpage, how to style my web page using CSS in my HTML code, add links, images, using CSS
					, and much more.
					<br>

					<b>Let us now look at a basic program of CSS: </b>
					<br>

				<code>
					h1 {
					<br>&nbsp color: red;
					<br>&nbsp font-size: 5em;
					<br>}
				</code>
				<br>
				<p> <b>The output of the code above is:</b> The style of h1 been the header is going to have its 
					text color red with a text size of 5 em which in pixels 80px which is big
